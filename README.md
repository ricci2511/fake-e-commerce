# fake-e-commerce

E-Commerce prototype app with a "different" UI design inspired by a mixture of various great posts found on Dribble.

- Add items to the shopping cart, increment/decrement the amount, remove items.
- Sign in with your google account.
- Items in the shopping cart are synced with your google account if you sign in.
- Filtering by categories.
- Responsive design.
- Cool animations.
